                Dear John,<br/>
                <br/>
                I am a pumpkin.<br/>
                O pumpkin, pumpkin, wherefore art thou pumpkin?<br/>
                Deny thy father and refuse thy name.<br/>
                Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love<br/>
                And I’ll no longer be an avocado.<br/>
                What’s in a fruit? That which we call a pumpkin<br/>
                By any other name would taste as sweet;<br/>
                So pumpkin would, were it not pumpkin call’d,<br/>
                Retain that dear perfection which it owes<br/>
                <br/>
                Love,<br/>
                Avocado
